This directory contains the StdPeriph libraries from ST, and the CMSIS core and device
support, all from ST.

The files have been put in different locations, and the Makefiles were written from scratch, but
all of the _code_ was provided as is by ST

Issues:
* No tracking of which version of which library (yet)
* All of these define assert_param() as empty.  That may not be what you
  want!
