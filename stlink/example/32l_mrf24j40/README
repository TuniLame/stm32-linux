This configures USART2 for 57600, 8N1, tx/rx on PA2/PA3.
It is used for debug output.

SPI2 on PB12..PB15 is used for a SPI interface to a microchip MRF24J40 module,
for 802.15.4 communications.

PB10 is used for the MRF24J40 reset pin, and PB2 for the IRQ

In addition, this shows the use of overriding  SystemInit() to set up clocks
differently.  (The STM32L starts up in 2Mhz MSI mode, not 16MHz HSI mode)
