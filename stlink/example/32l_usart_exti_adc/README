This configures quite a few things.

* ADC input on PA5.  When this is > 0x700 (half way) a user LED on PA4 turns on.
* USART2 configured for 57600, 8N1, with tx/rx on PA2/PA3
  Some minor trace is logged there...
* user button one (on the 32L discovery board) is an external interrupt, which
  changes the blink rate of the onboard LEDs

In addition, this shows the use of overriding  SystemInit() to set up clocks
differently.  (The STM32L starts up in 2Mhz MSI mode, not 16MHz HSI mode)
