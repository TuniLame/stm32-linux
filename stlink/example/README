Working good examples
* 32l_dac
* 32l_lcd
* blink

I haven't personally tested any of these on the F4 yet.

the F4 directories need a lot of cleanup too...

Don't trust many of these examples yet... A lot of them are a work in
progress...

A good source of examples is in the libopencm3 sources: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libopencm3/
