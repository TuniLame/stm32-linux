    From Flash: working
    From SRAM: doutbful...

Description:

This displays "on" then "off" on the LCD, while the green and blue LEDs
alternate.  The LEDs alternate to help you differentiate this example from
32l_dac, which blinks the two LEDs in time.

This will run from flash by default, which has been verified to work.  Running
from SRAM allegedly works, but is not fully tested.

To run from flash:
    make; make write

To run from sram:
    make BOOT_FLASH=0; ... good luck...

Requires the stdperiph driver for STM32L1xx to be built, see
../libs_stm/build, or just run: make -C ../libs_stm/build
