This is a known working example, for the STM32L Discovery board.

You should see the green and blue LEDs blink, and PA4 should be slowly rising
10mV per LED state change, showing off the DAC

If you get an error like, "cannot find -lstm32_stdperiph_l1xx", you haven't
built the stm32 stdperiph libraries yet...

make -C ../libs_stm/build/ then try building again
