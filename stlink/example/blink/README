This example blinks the onboard LEDs, and is configured to boot from flash.
It uses the basic CMSIS platform definitions from ST, but does not use the entire Standard Peripheral
Driver library.

To run from flash instead, simply issue, "make BOOT_SRAM=0"

Verified on Discovery 32VL
Verified on Discovery 32L (Blink speed is pretty slow, L chips start up at 2Mhz)
Not (currently) tested on 32F4
