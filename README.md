Stlink (with examples) + summon-arm-toolchain (~offline mode)

This project has been made from texane/stlink (https://github.com/texane/stlink/) and an offline version of esden/summon-arm-toolchain (https://github.com/esden/summon-arm-toolchain).

Offline mode means that all packages that summon-arm-toolchain script downloaded everytime are already present on this project, that's helps preventing a "diffrent version" problems.
